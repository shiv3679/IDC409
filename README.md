## Project Overview

### Speech-to-Text

The speech-to-text project aims to convert audio recordings of spoken words into written texts. It utilizes the [LibriSpeech dataset](https://www.openslr.org/12/) and employs the Wav2Vec2 model for audio processing and transcription.

### High-Energy Physics Data Analysis

HEP data analysis involves the classification of particles based on collision events. The project uses machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines in conjunction with dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and LDA.

### Web Scraping

The web scraping script collects faculty information from the [IISER Mohali website](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in), extracting details such as position, email, and research areas. The data is then stored in a SQLite database for further analysis.

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To execute a project script, navigate to the project's directory and run the corresponding files.
